MyTopix by Jaia Interactive was designed with the smaller sites and close-knit communities in mind. It has many features that other boards have minus all the bloat -- support for avatars, image uploading, etc, its all there. Mytopix has optional categories separation, or a simple 'no-category' flat topic listing where people can hold discussions. With an intuitive admin front end, and an easily editable template syntax, along with template and page caching, its poised to handle large datasets without issue. Who needs one of the big contenders when you can have EVERYTHING you need in a small HIGHLY extensible solution? Give MyTopix a whirl, and support your user driven community efficiently!
