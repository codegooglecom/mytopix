INSTALLING A MYTOPIX SVN SNAPSHOT:

Since the installer itself has not yet been updated to reflect the latest changes within the system, you're going to have to do a bit of dirty work getting it up and running properly.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a database for MyTopix
2. Apply the latest SQL dump included within the 'sql' directory of this package to the MyTopix database
3. Upload all contents within the 'upload' directory to the location of your MyTopix install on your webserver
4. CHMOD the following directories so they are writable by the system:

	path/to/mytopix/config/settings.php
	path/to/mytopix/lang/
	path/to/mytopix/lang/english/
	path/to/mytopix/skins/
	path/to/mytopix/skins/1/
	path/to/mytopix/skins/1/styles.css
	path/to/mytopix/skins/1/emoticons/
	path/to/mytopix/uploads/attachments/
	path/to/mytopix/uploads/avatars/

5. Open the 'config/settings.php' file and change the following values accordingly, save and upload:
	
	$config['site_link'] = 'http://www.mysite.com/forums'; // Path to your MyTopix web root
	$config['site_path'] = 'D://www-data//forums/';        // Direct absolute path to the root of MyTopix

6. Open the 'config/db_config.php' file and change the following values accordingly, save and upload:

	DB_HOST    <- Location of your SQL server. Use shortname or FQDN
	DB_NAME    <- Name of your MyTopix database
	DB_USER    <- Username of your database account
	DB_PASS    <- Password of your database account
	DB_PERSIST <- Use persistant connections
	DB_PORT    <- Port your SQL server uses
	DB_PREFIX  <- Table prefix ( leave this at 'my_' )
	DB_TYPE    <- Version of MySQL ( use either 'MySql41' or 'MySql' ). You may need to toggle this one around

7. Point your browser to your MyTopix installation and log on with the following credentials:

	username: root
	userpass: root

   !!!NOTICE: FOR SECURITY PURPOSES, RENAME YOUR ACCOUNT AND CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD WITHIN THE ACP!!!
